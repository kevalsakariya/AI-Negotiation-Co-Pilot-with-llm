# AI-Negotiation-Co-Pilot-with-llm
Built "AI Negotiation Co‑Pilot (OEP)", a full‑stack NLP web app that extracts and semantically indexes rules from PDFs (FAISS) and transcribes negotiation audio, enabling contextual Q&amp;A and multi‑turn conversation memory. Implemented a Flask backend with LangChain-based RAG, a vanilla‑JS streaming frontend, Colab-based embeddings/LLM inference.
